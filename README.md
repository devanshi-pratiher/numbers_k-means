# Finding Numbers from Datasets

## Description

The dataset contains these handwritten numbers. Using k-means, I found the clusters that have image IDs belonging to it. I clustered the data with different values of K âˆˆ [2,4,8,16]. For each K repeat the experiment for 5 different times each with random centroids and calculate the average Silhouette Coefficient
(SC) of each K after the 5 trials.

After constructing the SC scores, I plotted it as a function of K on the x-axis.
